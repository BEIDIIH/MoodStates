## Simple State Machine
#### by Beidi Han


### Overview
This is a template for a simple state machine that goes between five states


### Modifying the Template

(1) Replace the five PNG format pictures.
(2) Add custom drawing code to drawOne(), drawTwo(), drawThree(), drawFour(), drawFive()

### How it works
(1) There is one issue I meet, the text I entered didn't work, it still shows "State xxx".
